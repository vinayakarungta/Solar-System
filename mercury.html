At a distance of only about 1/3 of Earth's distance to Sun, Mercury is the first planet in our Solar System. <br>With a diameter of only 4880 kilometers (3032 miles) Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System. It is barely bigger than our Moon. <br>Not only is Mercury the smallest planet, it is also shrinking! <br><a href='index.html'>Back to home <a/></font>
