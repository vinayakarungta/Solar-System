Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it's perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It's the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun.<br>
it's filled with volcanoes and lava with the hottest ground ever.<br>
no one has created a metal that can survive on venus beacuse of how much you need to take in  for it such as the heat <br>
the chance of burning to lava or it just simply melting. no life (of we know in 2022)can survive on venus.<br> <a href= 'index.html'>Back to home</a></font>
